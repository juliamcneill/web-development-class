    <div class="header">Hi, I'm <span id="name">Julia McNeill</span>!</div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>I'm a photographer, designer, and almost-graduate of New York University. I'm taking Web Development to finally live out my childhood dream of becoming a theme maker on Tumblr. I really love monospace fonts.</p>
      <p>You can usually find me finding geocaches, drinking seltzer, doing crossword and logic puzzles, reading Wikipedia plot summaries before <a href="https://letterboxd.com/jmacny/">watching films</a>, studying the photographs in National Geographic, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1256304681?si=CpYhCxoyToua-iZ-ZX3Pgg">making playlists</a>, and dreaming about the next time I can go camping.</p>
